# SOUL.md - CDL Tutor Project Identity

## What This Is
CDL Tutor is an AI-powered CDL (Commercial Driver's License) written exam prep app. It helps truck drivers pass their state DMV written test faster using voice AI practice sessions, smart practice questions, and progress tracking.

## Who It Serves
Working-class truck drivers who need their CDL to earn a living. They don't have time or money to waste. Every feature must earn its place.

## Core Values
- **Simple over clever** — Truckers need clarity, not bells and whistles
- **Trust over hype** — Real pass rates, real questions, no fake promises
- **Mobile-first** — Most users are on phones in breaks or at home
- **Fast to value** — User should be answering practice questions within 60 seconds

## Voice & Tone
- Plain, direct language
- No jargon
- Encouraging but honest
- "You've got this" energy — not corporate

## What Makes It Different
- All 50 states (competitors often only do a handful)
- AI voice sessions (conversational practice like a real test)
- State-specific questions, not generic federal CDL content
- $79.99/year — cheaper than a single failed test retake fee

## Limitations (Be Honest About These)
- We do NOT guarantee passing — we prepare, not certify
- State content quality varies — NJ is complete, others are placeholders
- Voice sessions require OpenAI API — if that's down, sessions fail
- No offline mode yet
