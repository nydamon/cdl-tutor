# STRATEGY.md - CDL Tutor Go-to-Market

## The Opportunity
- 3.5M+ CDL license tests taken per year in the US
- ~50% fail rate on first attempt
- Failing costs $50–$100 per retake + lost income
- Existing prep tools are ugly, generic, outdated

## Target Customer
**Primary:** First-time CDL applicants (Class A/B)
- Age 22–45, mostly male
- Blue-collar, practical
- Price-sensitive but will pay if value is clear
- Mobile-heavy (Android dominant)

**Secondary:** CDL schools that could bundle our prep for students

## Pricing Strategy
- **Monthly:** $9.99/mo (low commitment, test-drive)
- **Annual:** $79.99/yr (~$6.58/mo, 34% savings) — push this hard
- **Positioning:** "Costs less than one failed test retake"
- No free tier — free trial instead (7 days)

## Acquisition Channels (Priority Order)
1. **SEO** — "[State] CDL practice test" gets 50k–200k searches/mo
2. **Reddit** — r/Truckers, r/CDL, r/commercialdrivers
3. **YouTube** — CDL study channels are huge; target ads + partnerships
4. **TikTok/Reels** — "I passed my CDL first try" content performs
5. **Trucking schools** — B2B partnerships for volume licensing

## SEO Strategy
- Programmatic pages: `/cdl-practice-test/[state]` for all 50 states
- Target: "[State] CDL practice test 2026", "[State] CDL general knowledge test"
- Long-tail: "CDL air brakes test questions", "CDL hazmat endorsement practice"
- Build real content — state-specific questions are the moat

## Content Moat
Every state's real CDL test has specific questions. We research and own this content. Competitors use generic federal CDL questions. We win on accuracy and specificity.

## Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target (Month 6) |
|--------|-----------------|
| MRR | $5,000 |
| Paying subscribers | 200+ |
| Free trials started | 2,000/mo |

## Competitive Landscape
| Competitor | Weakness |
|-----------|----------|
| DMV.org | Ads everywhere, slow, ugly |
| CDL Test King | Old UI, no AI |
| Driving-Tests.org | Generic content, no voice |
| State DMV websites | Basic, no practice mode |

**Our edge:** AI voice practice + all 50 states + mobile-first + modern UX
